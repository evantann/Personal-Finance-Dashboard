Project: Personal Finance Dashboard

Objective:
- Develope a web-based personal finance dashboard that displays recent transactions by spending category.
- Explore the development process behind making a website and how to integrate different software for app functionality.

Features:
- User registration and authentication system.
- Eatblish connection between user dashboard and financial institution.
- Expense tracking with categorized inputs and transaction history.

Methods and Tools:
Front End: Built using HTML and vanilla JavaScript
Back End: Node.js with Express and Plaid library for API integration and real-time transaction retrieval. mySQL integration for data storage.

Challenges and Solutions:
- This is my first personal project I've ever created. Not only is it my first project, but I had just learned Express and SQL less than a month ago. Having no experience and little to no guidance,
  I learned a lot from pure trial and error.
  Through persistence, however, I accomplished my goal and gained valuable insight into the web development workflow.
- I overcame these challenges by taking advantage the resources provided to me. I spent hours reading documentation and studying code form other developers. I posted questions on Stack Overflow and even contacted Plaid API support.
  Reading other people's code gave me so much insight and is truely where I learned the most. Not only did I improve my technical skills but I also learned the importance of code organization and project design.
  
Lessons Learned:
- I now know the logic and technology required to build a full-stack project.
- Organized code leads to a smoother development process.

Skills Demonstrated:
Full-stack development, data visualization, database management, proper repository and code organization, problem-solving, ability to learn new software quickly, ability to self-learn, version control,
identify and debug errors, development process timeline.

Relevance to the Role:
This project showcases my ability to design and develop practical applications, incorporating full stack technologies. It highlights my problem-solving skills and dedication to learn and apply knowledge.
