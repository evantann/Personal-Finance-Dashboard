**Objective**  
- Develope a web-based personal finance dashboard that displays recent transactions by spending category.
- Explore the development process behind making a website and how to integrate different software for app functionality.

**Features**  
- User registration and authentication system.
- Estblish connection between user dashboard and financial institution.
- Expense tracking with categorized inputs and transaction history.

**Methods and Tools**  
- Front End: HTML and vanilla JavaScript  
- Back End: Node.js with Express and Plaid library for bank connection and real-time transaction retrieval  
- Database: mySQL

**Challenges and Solutions**  
- This is my first personal project. I challenged myself to learn web development and complete a project by the end of summer. Having no prior experience and being completely self-taught, I learned through lots of trial and error. Through persistence, however, I accomplished my summer goal and gained valuable insight into the web development workflow.
- I overcame these challenges by creating a stratetic plan and having the consistency to follow through. I also took advantage of the resources provided to me - reading documentation and studying code form other developers. Reading other people's code gave me so much insight and is truely where I learned the most. Not only did I improve my technical skills but I also learned the importance of code organization and project design.
  
**Lessons Learned**  
- Understand the logic and technology required to build a full-stack project.
- Organized code leads to a smoother development process.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Full-stack development, data visualization, database management, code organization, problem-solving, ability to learn new software quickly, ability to self-learn, version control,
identify and debug errors, development process timeline.

**Relevance to the Role:**
This project showcases my ability to design and develop practical applications, incorporating full stack technologies. It highlights my problem-solving skills and dedication to learn and apply knowledge.
